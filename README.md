# Discriminants

This program uses the discriminant of the quadradic equation (b^2 - 4ac) and then takes three numeric variables that are input by the user for a, b, and c. After calculating the discriminant, the program checks for the number of real number roots. If the discriminant is greater than zero, the output displays that there are two real roots. If the discriminant is equal to zero, then there is one real root. Finally, there are no real roots if the discriminant is less than zero.
